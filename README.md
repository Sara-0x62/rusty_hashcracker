# rusty_hashcracker
A simple hash bruteforcer written in Rust (ðŸš€ Blazingly fast ðŸš€)
autodetects these hash types, and uses the correct hashing function
- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA2 -> (SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512)

Simple salt support - (might get reworked)
- Currently the salt is simply `hash(text + salt)`

The wordlist i used is the basic "rockyou.txt" but any wordlist should work.
If you're on Kali there should be several on your system by default.
